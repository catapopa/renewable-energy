        <h2>Network Analysis Concepts</h2>
        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>
          A community is a group of nodes that are more densely connected to
          each other than to the rest of the network, revealing patterns among
          locations.
        </p>
        <h3>PageRank</h3>
        <p>
          PageRank measures the importance of each location based on its
          connections, indicating which sites are most influential in the
          network.
        </p>
        <h3>Importance for the Project</h3>
        <p>
          In our project, understanding communities helps us identify areas that
          may benefit from similar renewable energy solutions, especially in
          regions with similar weather patterns. PageRank allows us to measure
          how important each location is, helping us find key players in
          renewable energy. This knowledge leads to better decision-making about
          where to invest in projects, ultimately creating a more sustainable
          future.
